I'm a master's student in Computer Science at [Duke University](https://cs.duke.edu), having completed my undergraduate studies in [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) with a minor in [Statistics](https://www.bu.edu/math/) at Boston University. I have research experience working with Professor Evimaria Terzi on the **Opinion Optimization** and **Team Formation** problems, focusing on aligning individuals with similar interests and enhancing decision-making strategies.

In the professional sphere, Iâ€™ve gained practical expertise as a machine learning engineer, with a focus on large language models. My work spans data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, agent evaluation, and the deployment of machine learning solutions.
