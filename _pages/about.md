I'm an undergraduate student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) and minoring in [Statistics](https://www.bu.edu/math/). Currently, I am engaged in research under the guidance of Professor Evimaria Terzi, focusing on **Opinion Optimization** problem.

In the realm of research, I've been working on the **Team Formation** problem, aiming to group people who share similar interests. Simultaneously, in the domain of practical application, I've been engaged in the full-stack development of web-based applications.
